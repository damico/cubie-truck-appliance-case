An Appliance Case to be used with CubieTruck board + SSD/HD + Battery pack

====
This is a project of a CubieTruck case, created with FreeCad 0.14. The original idea was build a case for CubieTruck board, with room for an SSD/HD and a battery pack. Also, the concept of this case does not includes roles for all ports of board, instead, only ethernet and power supply interfaces are accessible.

The project was tested with a 3D printer with PLA plastic.
